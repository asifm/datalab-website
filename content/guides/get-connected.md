# Making a Query

You can connect to the Research Data Lab to make queries through one of the following ways. 

:::: info Prerequisites
1. [Request access to the Data Lab](https://servicedesk.darden.virginia.edu/support/catalog/items/90) using your Darden Microsoft account. At this time, only the Darden faculty and select staff are eligible for access to the platform. Once you've been approved by administrators, you'll receive an email and gain the ability to log in. 
::::


## Query Data with Azure Data Studio or SQL Server Management Studio
The recommended SQL application for connecting to the Research Data Lab is [Azure Data Studio](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/data-studio), a cross-platform tool made by Microsoft. Azure Data Studio comes packaged with necessary drivers and libraries for getting started quickly. You may also use other client apps that support SQL Server, like [SQL Server Management Studio](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms?view=sql-server-ver16).
